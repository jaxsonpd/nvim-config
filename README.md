# Nvim configuration

This is my personal nvim configuration using lua. Origonally I used vim however in an attempt to move with the times I have switched to nvim. 

I do not recomend using this configuration as it barely works for me so good luck!

# Installation
## Install nvim
The best idea is to complie from source however I am very lazy and so perfer to use apt however the package needs to be updated so run the following:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/stable
```

This updates the source then you can run:

```
sudo apt-get install neovim
```
Then once in neovim run :PackerSync to install all packages
